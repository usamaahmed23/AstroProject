Create a new Markdown file named **docs.md** at the repository root. If it already exists, overwrite its contents.

Write **short, generic project documentation**. Keep it skimmable (roughly 150–250 words). 
Only use facts you can clearly see in the repo; leave `<placeholders>` if unsure. Do **not** invent details or include secrets.

Optional: if `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the project title.

--- docs.md (begin) ---
# ${$ARGUMENTS || "<Project Name>"}
